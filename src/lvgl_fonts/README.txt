Open the C font files in a text editor to see a list of the glyphs included.

Only one small and one standard font C file may be compiled into the program.
Alternate fonts have been included.
If you wish to use a different font, change the extension of the current font to .c_ALT
and change the extension of the font you wish to use to .c

For example, if you wish to use Fancy Pixels instead of X11_6x12-Fixed you would renname the files like so:
X11_6x12-Fixed_font_standard.c --> X11_6x12-Fixed_font_standard.c_ALT
Fancy_Pixels_font_standard.c_ALT --> Fancy_Pixels_font_standard.c
